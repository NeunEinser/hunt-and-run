# hunt-and-run

This is a simple datapack that can be used in any world and should be compatible with any other datapack that doesn't mofify the shulker box loot table (needs changing for a technical reason, will be obsolete in 1.17)

In this datapack, there are two teams: The Hunters and the Runners.

## Hunters
As a hunter, your goal is to kill all runners. You may die and respawn normally as often as you want.  
You will receive a compass that will point you towards the runner who is closest to you.

## Runners
As a runner, your goal is to kill the Ender Dragon.  
It doesn't matter who kills it, so even if it receives its killing blow from a hunter, it counts as a win towards the Runners.  
You only have one live. If you die, may it be a pvp kill by a hunter, by pve, or through enviornmental damage, you are out. If you play this with multiple runners, you as a team can still win.  
You can still regenerate health like usual with a full hunger bar, so this is **not** UHC for you.

## Rules
1. There are no rules  
You can do and play as you want. This may include trapping the obsidian platform in the end with lava. Just have a water bucket selected in your toolbar and be ready to run, I guess :wink:. The game will fill a certain area above the obsidian platform with air whenerver a player goes through, so you will have a sort of grace periode.  
Of course, you as a group can agree on any rules you seem fit.
